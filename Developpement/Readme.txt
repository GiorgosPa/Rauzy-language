This is the repository where we put our deliverables. Ours programs will be directly put into this repository without creating sub-repository. "Doc" will contend the manual that we will finish at last. "lib" will contend all the models that we create to test our programs, to explain our manual and to make our language more powerful. "Test_Chaogang" is a python program that I write to manipulate the example of Giorgos. We can our own "Test_xxx" to exchange our learning experiences on Python.
